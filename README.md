## Wanna contribute to my little project?
Please take a look at the issues and resolve one.

Issues are not necessarily bugs. they could be features. (Pun is not intended, but I'll pretend like it is)

If you're new to the world of open source and don't know how to use git, take a look at the [iusegit challenge](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/iusegit); it's so much fun! :smile:

### Setting up the development environment
* Just download and install [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) (version >= 5.9).
* Open the project in Qtcreator.
* Run the project.
